# WK4-IP-HYPOTHESIS-TESTING-AND-ANALYSIS-IN-PYTHON

### Description

- Week 4 Independent Project on Hypotheis testing, Univariate and Bivariate Analysis.

### Tests
1. The number of blue cars taken is higher during the weekend at 95% confidence interval.
- Null hypothesis: The number of blue cars is the same on average on any day.
- Alternative hypothesis:The number of blue cars is higher than average.

2. On average the number of free slots are the same on any day of the week, but some people claim that there are more free slots during weekdays. This test was done at 95% level of significance.
 - Null hypothesis: On average there are the same number of slots freed               
 - Alternative Hypothesis:  There are more free slots on weekdays
